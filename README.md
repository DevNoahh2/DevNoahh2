## Hey there! 👋 My name is Noah!

Hey! My name is Noah Richardson. I am 14 years old and live in small town in Southern California. I started getting into coding when I was in the 7th grade. I had gotten an interest for it when a couple of my friends started coding. However, I wasn't motivated to code anything. I wasn't interested in Websites or Games, Alexa Skills or Minecraft plugins, but, at sometime in 8th grade, I had started being more active on Discord. After some time being on Discord, I had found that Discord had an API and you were able to make bots on the platform! Knowing that, gave me motivation to start coding. Thus, my hobby for making Discord Bots was born. I currently know JavaScript, and a mild amount of Python. I love making Bots for not only my friends, but people that want to buy them from me. Thanks you so much for reading About Me, and I hope to talk to you soon.
